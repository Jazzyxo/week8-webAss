# week8-webAss
## This is a simple website showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## The colors used are simple and classy and not too harsh on the eyes in either dark or light mode.
## The only challenges i faced were in styling to make sure the page looked how it did and ensure everything i wanted came to be how i wanted them
## I deployed my website in GitHub which for me felt easier.
## Here is the url of the website is  https://jazzyxo.github.io/week8-webAss/
